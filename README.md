Hello :)
myself Sarash sahu
i made this project for my BCA final year.
its contains datacollection.py , signlanguagedetection.py
the data collection will help you to make your own data set. 
and the Signlanguage will help to detect the signs. it has three keyboard events 
1. Q - for terminations
2. C - for clearning the captured text area.
3. F - for deleting the last captured element.
Modify it as per use ;)
thank you
