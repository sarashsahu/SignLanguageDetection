Hello :)
I Sarash sahu
made this project for my BCA final year.
first, create the environment as per the requirement.txt and then use this pythons files
It contains datacollection.py , and signlanguagedetection.py
the data collection will help you to make your own data set. 
and the Signlanguage will help to detect the signs. it has three keyboard events 
1. Q - for terminations
2. C - for clearing the captured text area.
3. F - for deleting the last captured element.
Modify it as per use ;)
thank you
